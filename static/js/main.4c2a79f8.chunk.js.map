Because of this series of interactions, prices are\n              set by the provider, so they can charge the necessary prices to\n              turn a worthwhile profit, without gouging you, the customer.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Can I purchase directly from Deadibles?: Unfortunately no, we only\n              sell to providers to minimize sale interaction. Deadibles is\n              intended as a bulk product service, so unless you are buying\n              multiple oz/orders of something, you’ll likely need to interact\n              with your primary provider.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Will any information ever tie back to me?: No. The developers\n              behind Deadibles are career web developers, data privacy rights\n              enthusiasts and most of all, medicated chefs. We want to be able\n              to provide people with a service without the fear of\n              repercussions. In designing our webpage, we have taken as many\n              precautions as we can to avoid collecting your personal data, in\n              case the website/database are ever compromised. For starters, user\n              accounts are all pre-generated by an admin, to avoid any personal\n              details in login information. We also avoid collecting your\n              cookies (login/website history), utilize a password-protected\n              landing page, and our database will be cached (scrambled, saved,\n              and deleted from the actual database) regularly to avoid one big\n              long list of orders. Within the database, customers are only\n              referred to as an ID code, and providers are listed under\n              code-names, so to an outside source it will be practically\n              impossible for someone to mine personal information from our data.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Why pre-made passwords? : To avoid using peoples personal\n              information for accounts and in the spirit of going undetected as\n              a webpage/service, accounts are pre-generated with randomized\n              passwords. Because our website is password-protected, not just\n              anyone can access our store page. The website will automatically\n              log users out after 30 minutes of inactivity, and we intentionally\n              do not save cookies (your password), so that if a customer’s\n              device were to be confiscated, the hope would be that law\n              enforcement wouldn’t know what their random password goes to (let\n              alone if it is a password, given the randomness), and that their\n              device would be logged out of our store, in case they happened to\n              be browsing around any point in time.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Why do I keep getting logged out?\n              </p>\n            <ol>\n              <li>\n                <p>\n                didn’t move your screen for too long and our ‘inactive-user\n                removal system’ forced you out of the page\n                </p>\n              </li>\n              <li>\n                <p>\n                  you closed the\n              browser/tab and came back. Deadibles does NOT save cookies, so\n              your login information is NOT saved.
